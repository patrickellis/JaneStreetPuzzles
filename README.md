## Description
This repository serves to hold all of my solutions to the Jane Street Puzzles that I have solved thus far. I absolutely love how challenging (and rewarding) some of these puzzles have been, and as of the time of writing this comment (2021/04) I am continuing to adore the process of tackling some of the more difficult problems hosted by this hedge fund.
